# Daydream assets
Email and letter templates for Daydream Singapore, that can be modified into emails and printouts for other Daydreams too!

The files in the "Assets" folder are from Hack Club's official [Daydream](https://github.com/hackclub/daydream) repo. The graphics folder files are made by me
